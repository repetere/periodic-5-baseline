#### Periodic Runtime Options
```
$ npm start --e [name-of-environment (development by default)] # runs nodemon
$ npm run forever --e [name-of-environment (development by default)] # runs forever + nodemon
$ npm run deploy --e [name-of-environment (development by default)] # deploys with pm2
$ npm run sync # syncs dependencies
```
Running npm start saves the environment in `content/config/process/runtime.json`, if no environment is specified, it will reload in this environment, this is helpful server restarts
