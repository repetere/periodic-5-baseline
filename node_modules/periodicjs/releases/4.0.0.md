## Version 4.0.0

### Periodic 4.0.0, Dependency Injection and Resource Sharing. 
 * Fixes assets upload issue
 * Updated Theme Routes to resolve dependency injection conflicts, now throws an error
 * New dependency resource sharing is about 20/30% faster, reduced the number of required file I/O opertations

#### Periodic Migration guide from 3.2.0
 * make sure your extensions and themes return the reference to periodic resources "return periodic;", that's it!

#### Periodic Runtime Options
```
$ npm start --e [name-of-environment (development by default)] # runs nodemon
$ npm run forever --e [name-of-environment (development by default)] # runs forever + nodemon
$ npm run deploy --e [name-of-environment (development by default)] # deploys with pm2
$ npm run sync # syncs dependencies
```
Running npm start saves the environment in `content/config/process/runtime.json`, if no environment is specified, it will reload in this environment, this is helpful server restarts
